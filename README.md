## Time spent developing

Started on July 26 ~ Still currently working on it!

### Dev Notes.

This is a fun project to do. This is a website that I always find to want to create because of the lack in support of some websites regarding Manhwa. I could have probably finished this way easier if I sticked with using MERN but learning the hype of Next js is worth for the time that it'll take me to develop this.

### Built with

Next JS for Back-end and front-end  
MongoDB for the database structure  
Prisma for the middleware for postgres but still thinking if I want to continue using it.
